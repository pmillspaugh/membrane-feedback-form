# Membrane feedback form

This membrane program handles POST requests from a feedback form and notifies me via email. I wrote the program for [my digital garden](https://petemillspaugh.com), but you can fork it and extend it for any use case. The program also serves an example form, which you can play with by visiting [the program's built-in endpoint](https://studio-878-reserve-690-drawer-792-hat.hook.membrane.io/).

I wrote a <a href="https://www.petemillspaugh.com/membrane-feedback-form">blog post</a> and recorded a <a href="https://x.com/pete_millspaugh/status/1774581809558278517?s=20">demo on Twitter</a> if you're interested in learning more.</p>
